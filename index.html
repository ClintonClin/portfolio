          <h1> About Me</h1>
          <h2> My Background Education</h2>
            <p> In my entire life I have gone under different learning institutions Moringa School being one of them.<br>
                Am in Moringa School for my coding lessons and sharpen my coding skills. I have always wanted to be <br>
                good in coding so as to tackle more problems facing the society.<br>
                Before Moringa School, I attended Jomo Kenyatta University Of Agriculture and Technology for my <br>
                degree in Bachelor of Business and Information Technology. I joined jkuat in the year 2015 and <br>
                in the year 2018. I am yet to submit my projects so as to graduate.<br>
                From the year 2010 to 2014 I attended kisii School for my high school and thats where my interest<br>
                in praramming started growing stronger. I never did Computer studies in school but it always<br>
                puzzled me and intrested me to be a programmer and design programs that people could use in their<br>
                daily lives.
