    <h2><em> My Background Education</em></h2>
    <hr width= 30%>
      <p> In my entire life I have gone under different learning institutions Moringa School being one of them.
          Am in Moringa School for my coding lessons and sharpen my coding skills. I have always wanted to be
          good in coding so as to tackle more problems facing the society.
          Before Moringa School, I attended Jomo Kenyatta University Of Agriculture and Technology for my
          degree in Bachelor of Business and Information Technology. I joined jkuat in the year 2015 and
          in the year 2018. I am yet to submit my projects so as to graduate.
          From the year 2010 to 2014 I attended kisii School for my high school and thats where my interest
          in programming started growing stronger. I never did Computer studies in school but it always
          puzzled me and intrested me to be a programmer and design programs that people could use in their
          daily lives.
