          <h1> About Me</h1>
          <h2> My Background Education</h2>
            <p> In my entire life I have gone under different learning institutions Moringa School being one of them.<br>
                Am in Moringa School for my coding lessons and sharpen my coding skills. I have always wanted to be <br>
                good in coding so as to tackle more problems facing the society.<br>
                Before Moringa School, I attended Jomo Kenyatta University Of Agriculture and Technology for my <br>
                degree in Bachelor of Business and Information Technology. I joined jkuat in the year 2015 and <br>
                in the year 2018. I am yet to submit my projects so as to graduate.<br>
                From the year 2010 to 2014 I attended kisii School for my high school and thats where my interest<br>
                in praramming started growing stronger. I never did Computer studies in school but it always<br>
                puzzled me and intrested me to be a programmer and design programs that people could use in their<br>
                daily lives.
            <h2>Job experince</h2>
              My job experince is not that much since ive spent alot of time in school. though I have worked on a number<br>
              of companies in a span of two years for my attachment and experince. All this happened during the strike of<br>
              of lecturers. Firstly, I worked at Sanergy as a fellow for two and a half months as a sofware  developer.<br>
              Since I wasn't skilled enough, I worked under supervision from my mentors. We worked on a plaform called <br>
              Sales force. As developers, we added company modueles to salesforce for a needs as a company using a language <br>
              called apex together with SoQL.<br>
              I also worked for a comapny called Chokom Investment Limited as a system and network administrator. All I did<br>
              was manage the company's network and maintain systems to be upto date.<br>
